		<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Christy Desai, Okay Humans Co-Founder, CEO and LMFT, joined forces with the founders of Drybar and Squeeze to bring her new talk therapy concept to life. Boasting a combined 100+ years of launching and operating experience-driven,customer obsessed brands, the multifaceted team has their sights set on changing the way people experience retail across categories – and more importantly – leaving their mark on people’s lives, and the world, for good.</p>

			<p>Christy’s own experience with therapy turned into a personal mission to help other people feel better, stronger, and more alive. She believes there’s no reason why talking to a trained professional shouldn’t be as acceptable as going to the dentist, the hair salon, or seeking out a personal trainer. Okay Humans was designed to normalize seeking support, to rethink the outdated therapy model, and to open up the conversation about getting to okay.</p>
